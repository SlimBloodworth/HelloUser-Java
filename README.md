# HelloUser-Java
Beginner Java Project  getting input from keyboard built in JCreator
Directions I needed to follow:
Write a program that gets the user’s name and then tells the user hello. For example if John were
using the program, it would display “Hello John.” This program will store data with the type String.
Example Output:
Enter your name: Jake
Hello Jake!
